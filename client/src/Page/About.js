          <p> Jimmy and family from the ORIGINAL BUONO'S are BACK.  At Buono's we believe we stay true to NYC style pizza, by using fresh local ingredients. Buono's has been bringing New York-style pizza to Arizona since 1989!  Just like a local NYC neighborhood pizzeria.  We are an independently owned and operated pizzeria restaurant. Joining Jimmy is his fiance Shelly who is a Military Veteran and first responder as an ICU Nurse</p>
